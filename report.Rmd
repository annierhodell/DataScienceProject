### Introduction – What is your data? What the research question(s) you are investigating? Is there any relevant background information/literature that can help give context to your data/questions?

Our main data set in this project is birds_data. It contains different bird species measurements and behavior; such as their habitat, diet and migration patterns. The following variables of this data set are to be useful in our project.

:::: {style="display: flex;"}

:::{}

- Species ID: Unique identifier for species (or species group) linking to the Avibase dataset which provide detailed information on taxonomy, synonymy and distribution for the world's birds.

- Species_Name: Bird species name.

- Family: Family-level each bird species belongs to.

- Order: Order-level each bird family belongs to.

- Total Individuals: Number of individual birds measured for each species.

- Female: Number of measured female birds.

- Male: Number of measured male birds.

- Unknown: Number of birds measured with sex unknown.

- Complete Measures: Number of measured birds with a complete set of morphometric trait measurements.

```

:::

::::

- Hand-Wing Index: 100*DK/Lw, where DK is Kipp’s distance and Lw is wing length.

- Mass: Average body mass (male and female).

- Habitat: Habitat each bird species inhabits.

- Habitat Density: Density of habitat rated from 1 to 3. 1 = Dense habitats, 2 = Semi-open habitats, 3 = Open habitats. 

- Migration: Level of migratory behavior from 1 to 3. 1 = Sedentary, 2 = Partially migratory, 3 = Migratory.

- Trophic Level: Main diet level groups (Carnivore, Omnivore, Herbivore, Scavenger)

- Trophic Niche: Niche diet level, sub categories of Tropic Level groups.

- Primary Lifestyle: Main lifestyle activity taken up by species.

- Range Size: The total area of the mapped range of the species.


### Methods – Summarise what cleaning/pre-processing you have done to your data. Brief description of data science techniques you have used in your investigation.

### Results – Tables, figures and summary values from your exploratory investigation. Summary of a fitted statistical model, such as estimates, plots and fit statistic. A brief explanation of what the results mean in the given context of your data.

### Discussion – Answers your research question(s). What are the advantages/limitations of the investigation you have performed? If applicable, are there any ethical considerations in relation to your investigation/findings?
