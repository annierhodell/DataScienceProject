# Introduction 

In this project we want to investigate the correlation between the diets and beak measurements of birds. 

Bird beaks often vary in size due to habitat and diet, as proven by Darwin. We want to figure out if you can predict a birds' diet based on their beak measurements alone.

### Our Data

Our main data set for this project is birds_data. It contains different bird species measurements and behavior; such as their habitat, diet and migration patterns. 

We will be focusing on the following variables of this data set that are useful in our project:

:::: {style="display: flex;"}

:::{}

- Species ID: Unique identifier for species (or species group) linking to the Avibase dataset which provide detailed information on taxonomy, synonymy and distribution for the world's birds.

- Total Individuals: Number of individual birds measured for each species.

- Complete Measures: Number of measured birds with a complete set of morphometric trait measurements.

- Beak Length: The nares length is measured from the front edge of the nostril to the tip of the beak (see fig 1). We've chosen to focus on nares length over culmen length (the length from the tip of the beak to the base of the skull) as beak width and depth also refer to the nostril location, whereas the culmen length refers to the skull.

- Beak Width: Width of the beak at the front edge of the nostrils (see fig 1).

- Beak Depth: Depth of the beak at the front edge of the nostrils (see fig 1).

```

:::

::::

- Tarsus Length: Length from the notch between tibia and tarsus, to the bend of the foot (see fig 1).

- Wing Length: Length from the bend of the wing to the tip of the longest primary feather (unflattened wing) (see fig 1).

- Kipps Distance: Length from the tip of the first secondary feather to the tip of the longest primary feather (see fig 1).

- Secondary Length: Length from the bend of the wing to the tip of the first secondary feather (see fig 1).

- Tail Length: Distance between the tip of the longest tail feather and the point at which the tail protrudes from the skin (see fig 1).

- General Trophic: Main diet level groups (Carnivore, Omnivore, Herbivore, Scavenger)

- Niche Trophic: Niche diet level, sub categories of Tropic Level groups.

### Methods – Summarise what cleaning/pre-processing you have done to your data. Brief description of data science techniques you have used in your investigation.

### Results – Tables, figures and summary values from your exploratory investigation. Summary of a fitted statistical model, such as estimates, plots and fit statistic. A brief explanation of what the results mean in the given context of your data.

### Discussion – Answers your research question(s). What are the advantages/limitations of the investigation you have performed? If applicable, are there any ethical considerations in relation to your investigation/findings?
