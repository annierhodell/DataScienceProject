### Introduction – What is your data? What the research question(s) you are investigating? Is there any relevant background information/literature that can help give context to your data/questions?

In this project we want to investigate whether you can predict a bird's diet from its beak measurements. 

Our main data set for this project is birds_data. It contains different bird species' measurements and behavior; such as their habitat, diet and migration patterns. 

The following variables of this data set are to be useful in our project.

:::: {style="display: flex;"}

:::{}

- Species ID: Unique identifier for species (or species group) linking to the Avibase dataset which provide detailed information on taxonomy, synonymy and distribution for the world's birds.

- Species Name: Bird species name.

- Family: Family-level each bird species belongs to.

- Order: Order-level each bird family belongs to.

- Total Individuals: Number of individual birds measured for each species.

- Female: Number of measured female birds.

- Male: Number of measured male birds.

- Unknown: Number of birds measured with sex unknown.

- Complete Measures: Number of measured birds with a complete set of morphometric trait measurements.

- Beak Culmen Length: Length from the tip of the beak to the base of the skull (see fig 1).

- Beak Nares Length: Length from the front edge of the nostrils to the tip of the beak (see fig 1).

- Beak Width: Width of the beak at the front edge of the nostrils (see fig 1).

- Beak Depth: Depth of the beak at the front edge of the nostrils (see fig 1).

- Tarsus Length: Length from the notch between tibia and tarsus, to the bend of the foot (see fig 1).

- Wing Length: Length from the bend of the wing to the tip of the longest primary feather (unflattened wing) (see fig 1).

- Kipps Distance: Length from the tip of the first secondary feather to the tip of the longest primary feather (see fig 1).

- Secondary Length: Length from the bend of the wing to the tip of the first secondary feather (see fig 1).

- Hand-Wing Index: 100*DK/Lw, where DK is Kipp’s distance and Lw is wing length.

- Tail Length: Distance between the tip of the longest tail feather and the point at which the tail protrudes from the skin (see fig 1).

- Avg Mass: Average body mass (male and female).

- Habitat: Habitat each bird species inhabits.

- Habitat Density: Density of habitat rated from 1 to 3. 1 = Dense habitats, 2 = Semi-open habitats, 3 = Open habitats. 

- Migration: Level of migratory behavior from 1 to 3. 1 = Sedentary, 2 = Partially migratory, 3 = Migratory.

- General Trophic: Main diet level groups (Carnivore, Omnivore, Herbivore, Scavenger)

- Niche Trophic: Niche diet level, sub categories of Tropic Level groups.

- Primary Lifestyle: Main lifestyle activity taken up by species.

- Range Size: The total area of the mapped range of the species.
