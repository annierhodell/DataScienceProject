##Investigating the Corellation Between The Diet of Birds and Their Beak Measurement

Our aim is to prove that birds with similar diets will have similar beak sizes.

#Prediciting The Diet Of The Bird Based Of Their Beak Measurements

When creating our models we decided to focus on predicting the diets of birds who are:
- Carnivores: A species whose diet consists of at least 70% of food resources from consuming live animals.
- Herbivores: A species whose diet consists of at least 70% of food resources from consuming plants.

We decided to leave out scavenger birds since they make up less than 1% of our data and so using them may of led to false predictions.

We also left out Omnivores, this was due to the overlapping diets that they have in correlation to Carnivores and Herbivores. An Omnivore is a species whose diet consists of a mixed consumption of plants and animals at an approximately equal rate. This means that their beak measurements doesn't have as definite relationships as the Carnivores and Herbivores, which may have also lead to false predictions.

#Prediciting Whether a Bird is a Carnivore
```{r Bird Model data tidying, include=FALSE}
birds_model <- birds_data %>%
  filter(!General_Trophic == "NA") %>%
  mutate(
    Carnivore_Status = factor(ifelse(General_Trophic == "Carnivore", "Carnivore", "Not Carnivore"),
                              levels = c("Not Carnivore", "Carnivore")),
    
    Herbivore_Status = factor(ifelse(General_Trophic == "Herbivore", "Herbivore", "Not Herbivore"),
                              levels = c("Not Herbivore", "Herbivore")),
    
    Omnivore_Status = factor(ifelse(General_Trophic == "Omnivore", "Omnivore", "Not Omnivore"),
                             levels = c("Not Omnivore", "Omnivore")))


#splitting our data

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)
# Create an initial split (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing)
split_data <- initial_split(birds_model, prop = 0.8)
train_data <- training(split_data)
test_data <- testing(split_data)
```

```{r Model for Carnivore, include=FALSE}
#model for predicting if a carnivore or not based on beak data (model C)
birds_rec_C <- recipe(Carnivore_Status ~ Beak_Nares_Length + Beak_Width + Beak_Depth, data = train_data) %>%

# Making the predictor

# ROC for carnivore

# Using xaringan

---

# xaringan

- The presentation is created using the `xaringan` package

- Use `---` to separate slides and `--` for incremental builds

--

- Like this

---

# Layouts

You can use plain text

- or bullet points

.pull-left[
or text in two columns $^*$
]
.pull-right[
- like
- this
]

.footnote[
[*] And add footnotes
]

# Plots

```{r recode-species, echo = FALSE}
# In this chunk I'm doing a bunch of analysis that I don't want to present 
# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.
iris_modified <- iris %>%
  mutate(Species = fct_other(Species, keep = "setosa"))
```

```{r plot-iris, echo = FALSE}
# Code hidden with echo = FALSE
# Uses modified iris dataset from previous chunk
# Play around with height and width until you're happy with the look
ggplot(data = iris_modified, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal() # theme options: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html
```

---

## Plot and text

.pull-left[
- Some text
- goes here
]
.pull-right[
```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width=4, echo=FALSE}
# see how I changed out.width and fig.width from defaults
# to make the figure bigger
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = species, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()
```
]

---

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r iris-table, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(iris), format = "html")
```

---

# Images

```{r castle, eval=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=, include=FALSE, out.width="55%"}
include_graphics("img/edinburgh-castle.jpg")
```

Or you can also include a full page image. See next slide.

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcome to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
